        <br> &nbsp;
        I am Joshua Roldan, a student at the (UNAM) National Autonomous University of Mexico.
        <br> &nbsp;
        They are currently studying Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering.<br> &nbsp;
        <br> &nbsp;
        At only 23 years old and I'm constantly learning since I haven't finished my degree yet, I really want to learn
        about the world <br> &nbsp;
        that surrounds me and get to know other places and learning spaces

            <br> &nbsp;
            I really like listening to electronic music. I consider that this genre has always been present in all generations, it will continue to do so. I also listen to indie music, salsa, banda and a little cumbia.
            <br> &nbsp;
            I love watching movies<br>
            - watch some series<br>
            - read interesting news<br>
            - watch videos about discoveries in the field of science<br>

                <br> &nbsp;
                I practice sports such as soccer and basketball, in general I like to do all kinds of outdoor activities.
                <br> &nbsp;
                I consider that they are good for our health and to maintain an appropriate and adequate mental health to be able to live day to day in a formidable way.<br> &nbsp;

                    I would very much like to learn more programming languages.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                    I would also like to learn about quantum physics, quantum mechanics and a little about the universe.<br> &nbsp;
                    <br> &nbsp;
                    I consider that it is a field in which I don't know if there is much to explore, so knowledge is very scarce in this sense, but I think we could delve a little deeper into this type of subject and be able to discover new planets, new horizons, and this would give us more knowledge about life outside planet Earth.<br> &nbsp;
